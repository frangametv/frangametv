## ðŸ’»iP1X3L GamesðŸ’»
I'm the CEO of iP1X3L Games, a development team specialized in games, but sometimes we also do softwares like Pearl, we have some servers around the world and our team is small but not so small; we also develop AI but as a private and secret project. We build games in Unity and Unreal Engine, and in projects like Eneider (Unity) we built a network of servers and database to achive a multiplayer experience.
